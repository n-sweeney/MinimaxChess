# Minimax Chess
Chess implemented using minimax for the Computer 'AI'.

This project was originally completed in 2022 and has been migrated to my GitHub.

Currently the depth is limited due to performance when consulting large trees. This will be resolved in further alterations introducing tree pruning methods such as (alpha-beta pruning) and by adding move highlighting to aid the player's decisions.

Additionally, the GUI does not include a time, score of taken pieces, whos go it is and other vital information which will be added in later revisions
